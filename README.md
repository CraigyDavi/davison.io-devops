# davison.io DevOps

Development operations & infrastructure managing [davison.io](http://davison.io) and related sites. Powered by Ansible.

## 'Always' tasks

'Always' tasks are idempotent, meaning if you run them again, **they will make only the changes they must in order to bring the system to the desired state**. This makes it very safe to rerun the same playbook multiple times. They wonâ€™t change things unless they have to change things. - Ansible Docs

- **inventory/always** defines which hosts use 'always' tasks
- **always.yml** is a playbook which runs all always tasks on all hosts. You can consider this the root/main playbook which does everything.
