##### What does 'okay' mean?

'Okay' tasks are idempotent, meaning if you run them again, **they will make only the changes they must in order to bring the system to the desired state**. This makes it very safe to rerun the same playbook multiple times. They wonâ€™t change things unless they have to change things. - Ansible Docs
